Investors must look into risk-reward ratios and make sure that even if a coin is good at making money, it has to be able to minimize its risk as well.

This [term was the Golden Mean](https://philosophybreak.com/articles/the-golden-mean-aristotle-guide-to-living-excellently/). The Golden Mean can also apply to virtue in investing and picking assets. The balance between the two extremes is what Aristotle was looking for. Where there is a point of perfection and virtue. If you have an asset too risky, then you may end up losing all your profits. On the other end, if you have an asset that is not risky enough, you may not have profit potential. We use financial ratios to locate this point in the middle, leaving the asset with the highest ratio, the closest to this Golden Mean.\n'
