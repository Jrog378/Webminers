We can do this by using price data and allowing our AI to process it, telling us which the [best assets are and why](next-big-crypto). Another aspect that AI can help with is balancing a portfolio. If an investor would like a specific set of assets in their portfolio at all times it can be difficult to know how much of what will bring you the most profit. When we use AI to balance our assets, we can include the specific data that should be included in the evaluation.

[Becoming an AI Quant](ai-quant-investing) is how you master both of these resources and maximize the potential of AI to the best of its ability.

AI has to be trained on previous code to be able to give you the answers you want and since it has never been done before, it requires the thinking of a developer.

When using this technology in [decentralized finance](decentralization-for-crypto), you can create thousands of images based on your style to create an NFT collection that you can make money on if you build the right community.
