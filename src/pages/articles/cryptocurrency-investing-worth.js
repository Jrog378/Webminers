Decentralization has been gaining traction in recent years, and there are several reasons why it\'s worth being a part of. Decentralization offers greater resilience. In a centralized system, a single point of failure can bring down the entire system. Decentralization, however, is more resilient to failure. This ensures that even if one node fails, the system as a whole will continue to function.\n' +

In traditional centralized systems, decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or organizations. This can lead to corruption and abuse of power, as there is little transparency or accountability. Decentralization, on the other hand, distributes decision-making power among a broader network of users, making it more difficult for any one person or organization to abuse their power. In this way, decentralization planning promotes greater transparency and accountability, essential for building trust in any system.\n' +
