You can set the price by offering to sell crypto at a certain price, but at the end of the day, the buyer is the one who has to accept it so you should not expect it to be an [efficient asset](/efficiency) immediately. The fewer investments in your cryptocurrency, the fewer offers. We all know that in supply and demand when supply is high and demand is low, prices will fall. This is why many cryptos start as fractions of cents, no one is willing to buy them for more.\n' +
                '\n' +
                'People are afraid to [make a mistake](biggest-crypto-mistakes) when investing their hard-earned money, and until crypto is proven to be a reasonable asset, they will remain out of that market. If you build a cryptocurrency community, you can [build trust with potential investors](https://cryptogeek.info/en/blog/how-to-create-and-lauch-your-own-cryptocurrency). By building trust you are giving them a reason to buy your crypto even if you are just starting. A community is also a great way to maintain people who have already invested money by continuing to provide them value.\n' +
                '\n' +
                'Bitcoin even started with its price extremely small when it [first created its blockchain](what-is-the-crypto-blockchain). The initial price was only fractions of a cent. As time went on it drew more and more demand along with technology, causing prices to rise in the future. When looking at its price history you can see consistent times when the price went way up in value, and then fell. The important part is that Bitcoin was able to continue to give investors opportunities to make a profit. Other cryptos are currently just starting at fractions of a penny, however, they won’t find high prices the good old-fashioned way, as Bitcoin did. Rather than compete with the popular cryptos for attention, they are going to have to find new ways to gain investors because Bitcoin already has the top rank.\n' +

                'Big will coins only continue to attract more investors, they grab more attention and outshine the [smaller cryptos and altcoins](what-is-an-altcoin). More attention means more demand and more demand means more profit. Due to having more investors, larger cryptos also have more people in the markets both making and losing money. Even investors with a ton of money, also known as crypto whales, were in the markets, regular investors can still make a profit because everything ends up balancing out due to the total amount of people investing. With altcoins, [if a whale were to come in](https://builtin.com/cryptocurrency/crypto-whale), the price could be heavily manipulated.\n'

Due to their being more investors, we can investigate popular cryptos\' downside potential compared to altcoins. When looking at price history we can see that [during crypto market crashes](crypto-market-crashes), everyone panics. No matter what crypto you are looking at, the market psychology involved in a market crash gets everyone emotional and they sell out of fear, pushing the price down even lower.\n' +
                '\n' +
                'Small coins can often fall to zero. The benefits of investing in popular cryptocurrencies on the other hand are that their falls only go to a certain level before it is recoverable. This shows us that the cryptocurrencies with more investors involved often fall less in the case of a [big drop in price for the whole market](what-is-a-crypto-bubble). Popular cryptos being more efficient might not be too much of a surprise when we take a look at why. Since they have more investors, these investors have a certain point where they believe the market will stop crashing and gain trust again. Once their crypto reaches that, they will begin to buy again even if crypto continues to fall a little. These investors eventually have enough support to hold the price from falling anymore and continue on its path from there.\n' +
                '\n' +
                'With smaller cryptos, we see less of this. Many investors will completely leave a small crypto after some losses, to put their money in a popular crypto that many people already trust. When you use a mix of altcoins and popular cryptos to determine how to [diversify your portfolio](/balancing) with popular cryptocurrencies, the altcoins will be considered risky and the popular cryptos will be considered safer. When things start to go poorly altcoins become less valuable to [have in your wallet](https://crypto.com/university/crypto-wallets) and this only inflates how bad the crashes are because people stop trusting their altcoins. The new best way to diversify your portfolio with popular cryptocurrencies is to start moving their balances to their safe holdings in an attempt to limit losses.\n' +
                '\n' +
                'Losses are a driving force for investors, when someone has started in Bitcoin, moved to an altcoin, and lost a lot of money, they aren’t just going to go to another altcoin. Most of these investors will go back to popular cryptocurrencies so they can avoid the same type of loss in the future. Altcoins do not act the same as main coins. The [price is not as smooth](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-benefit-from-bitcoin-volatility-with-market-analysis-and-trading-bots) and they tend to be more volatile, making it a lot harder to use altcoins in determining how to manage your risk when investing in popular cryptocurrencies.\n'

                'The history of a cryptocurrency is great for determining how to reduce risk when investing in popular cryptocurrencies. Price can tell you about pump-and-dump scams, as well as if the crypto has fallen to zero or if investors were able to find support. History can often generally repeat itself and seeing violent unpredictable movements in the past should be warning you about them happening in the future. The past of cryptocurrencies can help show investors that the crypto that they are looking into can be trusted and also shows how loyal investors have been over the years. A Crypto with a lot of [long-term investors](https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/long-term-crypto-investment) will have people who depend on the asset and a good history helps newer investors measure and compare it as a better choice than the alternatives.\n' +
                '\n' +
                'If crypto has been a reliable choice that continually brings investors profit, then why would anyone leave? The group of investors would only grow more and more until it is considered a popular cryptocurrency just from the steady reliability. Loyalty is built through treating the investors well many times over again. When you have a large history of loyal customers they are willing to put up with a few hiccups along the road to stick with the crypto they love.\n' +

When new investors come in, this makes the profits even better, the crypto more reliable, and the asset as a whole more popular. It is similar to a cycle where investors who have been with crypto for a while are part of the history that draws in new investors who then make history again by combining the old and the new. If an altcoin has been around for the same amount of time as a popular cryptocurrency and is not as popular, you have to ask yourself why not. Most of the time you will see it lacks efficiency and is just not as good at bringing investors profit.\n'
