I used [kaggle] for datasets and knew that if I wanted to be a professional in the field then my work would have to be similar to those who were competing in coding competitions, but everything looked so complicated.\n'

After I felt I had worked enough, I thought about how much work I just did for a single website and the fact that I did not want to do that for every customer I had. The website I was creating took a lot of effort and specialization, and I knew it was only authentic to me. I felt like I only wanted to develop for myself.\n' +
