            text: 'Cryptocurrencies are a new and growing technology that is a part of the blockchain. Since the blockchain is constantly getting attention from its developing innovation, as a side effect crypto does as well. Whether it be choosing the [best efficient cryptos](/efficiency) to pick from or negative press, cryptocurrency news remains a hot topic. Due to this attention, there comes the consequence of getting noticed by governments who would like to regulate and control the world of decentralization to impose their version of safety. In the community of crypto investors, this is not very popular because regulation by the government means less risk to them, this regulation also means that privacy would be controlled by a central entity, which is exactly what the [blockchain strived to prevent](what-is-the-crypto-blockchain).\n' +

                'Even though regulation is something that could help prevent large dips or [falls in the markets](what-is-a-crypto-bubble), investors have to ask themselves if it is worth it if they have to give up their privacy. Crypto is transparent yet private, being a peer-to-peer transaction-based system, there are a lot of questions about what regulation will do to it. When it comes to regulation, we know from experience how negative this could result.\n' +

                'In the case of USDC, a stablecoin backed by the dollar, there was a [large plummet](crypto-market-crashes) away from the value of the dollar.

This crypto had some of its reserve, provided by Silicon Valley Bank, [which after its failure](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/17/why-silicon-valley-bank-collapsed-svb-fail), revealed some dark secrets about paper currency-backed stablecoins. USDC was highly regulated by SVB and when this bank crashed, it affected the entire cryptocurrency market. The idea of regulation scared investors, especially when they did not even know that something like that was happening to them.\n' +
                '\n' +
                'The other form of regulation is not just on stablecoins but the fact that [cryptocurrency provides privacy](https://crypto.com/university/privacy-cryptocurrencies). The government also wants to crack down on fraudulent activity like hacking, money laundering, and tax evasion. Regulation will sacrifice the privacy of crypto investors to get those things. The clashing of decentralized privacy and government control can be a treat for the media as it is a topic that many people are interested in. This news will then circulate back into the markets and affect how investors act. Bad news will decrease the number of buyers and good news will increase this number.\n'

Knowing how to stay calm in the face of market volatility is a skill of a high-level investor.

The emotional impact of crypto news can amplify how investors feel, leading to them talking about their losses or if they are losing hope for profit while sentiment is ranked low. When social media users are talking about their wins and all excited to invest in cryptocurrency, we know the market sentiment will be high. It is extremely hard to determine how to identify news that is likely to impact the crypto market, however, one method you can use is checking the sentiment of social media after possibly impactful articles come out.\n' +

                'Even more so than knowing what the sentiment currently is, crypto investors need to understand what makes sentiment change and how this affects the markets. If there is a great piece of news that comes out like how cryptocurrency is [helping businesses keep themselves secure](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain-security), then sentiment will have a good rating. People will begin talking about how crypto is helping out businesses and it is a great thing to have in stores or restaurants.
