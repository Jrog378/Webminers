Crypto staking is a way for you to be able to invest your money in a secure location, like a bank if it were decentralized, and earn interest on that money by being the future of crypto lending and trading. This money, since stored in a node, will not be fully used by the organization you are lending it to, allowing for more security of your money than regular banks. Every staking company should not be trusted though since there are some bad apples. [With decentralization](decentralization-for-crypto), there are almost no regulations on who can ask for your money. It is important to research who you will be working with so that you know that they have a strong history and can be trusted with your money.\n'

Being a digital currency has its perks as you can transfer large amounts of money in a short time and the money is yours.

Smart contracts use the crypto blockchain to set up a list of required steps that have to be completed before a trade can be finalized. Those who want double-sided protection when making business deals can use these types of agreements, as long as the other party agrees as well. The transfer of goods or services can be done by using the digital currency of crypto and once all parameters are met, [the two sides swap](blockchain-transaction), giving away the money and what the customer paid for.\n' +

Smart contracts will only be getting smarter and used more frequently. Although these contracts are growing with the use of the crypto blockchain, there is still no telling if they will become the standard of contracts in the future or just a useful alternative.\n'
