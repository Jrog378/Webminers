However, that only tells part of the story because there can be a lot of risks that took place to create those profits. That leaves us with a term called asset efficiency. Asset efficiency measures how good an asset\'s returns are while considering the losses required to get there. It is also the best way to build your millionaire crypto portfolio.\n' +

                'There are two forms of cryptocurrency efficiency in this market, and they come from time and place. The place is which asset you choose. Efficient cryptos are hard to find if you donâ€™t know what you are looking for. We can use risk-to-reward ratios that you can check out for free with our [Cryptocurrency Efficiency page](/efficiency). The second form of efficiency comes in when you invest. Even though Making money when crypto goes down isn\'t impossible, investing in a bull market is much better than [in a bear market](what-to-do-in-bear-markets) as the price moves more favorably. You can catch uptrends without worrying as much about downside risk as crypto investing during a recession since we are still going up in the long term. Both of these aspects are essential to successful cryptocurrency investment strategies.\n' +

We can perform [international transactions with cryptocurrency](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-use-crypto-for-cross-border-payments/) without needing currency conversions or high fees. Traditional methods of transferring money across borders can take days to complete and often involve high fees charged by banks or other financial institutions.

One of these advancements is the rise of cryptocurrencies, which have been around [for over a decade](https://www.cryptovantage.com/guides/a-brief-history-of-cryptocurrency/). Still, it is only in recent years that they have gained significant attention and adoption. More and more people are becoming interested in investing in cryptocurrencies, as they offer many benefits over traditional currencies. Those with large sums of money prefer to have that in assets rather than cash. Since cryptocurrency is fully digital and not reliant on an outside company, this attracts millions of dollars in investments that raise prices every time they are invested. This makes [making money with cryptocurrency](https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/crypto/how-to-make-money-fast-with-cryptocurrency/) even more accessible.\n' +

                'Businesses and institutions have begun to [accept cryptocurrencies] as a form of payment, and it is clear that the adoption of cryptocurrencies is on the rise. In fact, some experts predict that cryptocurrencies could eventually replace traditional currencies altogether. As more companies adopt cryptocurrencies, we will see assets like Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies used as payment instead of cash or credit card. We have also seen large investment firms start to pool large sums of money for investing in cryptocurrency. All of these actions will increase the price and profitability of cryptocurrency.\n' +
                '\n' +
                'Cryptocurrencies are also more accessible to people who do not have access to traditional banking systems. With cryptocurrencies, you only need an internet connection and [a digital wallet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin-wallet.asp), which can be set up in minutes. While banks can be regional, cryptocurrency is worldwide. If the country has not banned cryptocurrency, you have a personally managed bank in your pocket or online. Despite these benefits, many people still need to learn to adopt cryptocurrencies. Some are intimidated by the complex technology behind cryptocurrencies, while others are concerned about the potential risks and volatility of the market.\n'

Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies are not governed by any single entity. This [decentralization attracts investors](decentralization-for-crypto), driving profits into crypto and allowing us to make money on the blockchain.\n' +

                'A cryptocurrency network is run by a community of users who validate transactions and maintain the [ledger technology](https://hedera.com/learning/distributed-ledger-technologies/what-are-distributed-ledger-technologies-dlts). This makes cryptocurrencies more resilient to attacks and censorship. It also means no one can manipulate the network for their benefit. This decentralization is driving profits in several ways. First, it has led to the creation of new investment opportunities. For example, decentralized finance platforms, or DeFi platforms, are built on this [blockchain technology](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-blockchain/), allowing users to earn interest on their crypto holdings. These platforms offer higher yields than traditional banks and are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Providing this service lets the networks run efficiently while still providing the community with support for helping.\n' +

                'Decentralization has made it easier for investors to access new markets. In traditional finance, investors are limited to the financial markets their brokers can access. With cryptocurrencies, anyone can invest in any project, regardless of location. This has opened up new opportunities for investors to profit from emerging technologies and trends. There are many [categories of cryptocurrencies](https://crypto.com/price/categories), ranging from different forms of technology. \n' +

                'The last benefit we will mention comes in the form of control over your money. While banks or centralized entities can seize your funds and prevent you from getting them back, whether, in a financial crisis or bankruptcy, [DeFi platforms](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/) allow you to continue holding all your funds. No matter what happens in the market or world, it is up to you when to take out your money, not someone else. Decentralization has made it easier for investors to protect their assets. Traditional financial institutions are subject to government regulations and oversight.\n'

            text: 'The popularity of non-fungible tokens, also known as NFTs, in the crypto space has been a good thing for the technology behind them and investors in the crypto area. These unique digital assets are helping to drive up the price of cryptocurrencies by getting more investors involved with the crypto platform. In many cases, [NFTs are creating a new market](potential-of-nfts) for digital assets requiring cryptocurrency to purchase these assets. In the past, digital items such as music, art, and videos were challenging to monetize. NFTs have changed that by allowing creators to sell unique, one-of-a-kind digital items to collectors. \n' +
                '\n' +
                'The creation of NFTs has led to increased activity on blockchain networks. This increased activity has resulted in higher transaction volumes and fees, which drives up the price of cryptocurrencies. This is because the more people use a blockchain network, the more valuable that network becomes. As more people invest in cryptocurrencies to participate in the NFT market, the demand for these currencies increases, driving their prices up. NFTs are scarce as each NFT is unique and cannot be replicated, making them highly sought after by collectors. This scarcity has created a sense of exclusivity and value around NFTs.\n' +
                '\n' +
                'NFTs can potentially revolutionize many industries that crypto alone might not have the reach to do. For example, NFTs can represent in-game items such as weapons and skins [in the gaming industry](video-games-with-the-blockchain). This creates a new revenue stream for game developers and allows players to truly own their in-game assets. This increased use of NFTs in different sectors will help to further drive up the price of cryptocurrencies since we know the two are neighboring markets with some correlations. As the use of NFTs continues to grow, we can expect to see even more demand for cryptocurrencies and an increase in their value.\n'

Of course, this also means higher cryptocurrency risks come with this extra movement. Cryptocurrencies offer more diversity in investment options.
