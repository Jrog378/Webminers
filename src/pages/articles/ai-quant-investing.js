There are many options for programming languages to pick from, however, the most popular in the world is Python. [Python can be used for investing](python-for-finance) in many ways including data analysis, data collection, automation, and eventually AI. All of these abilities fall under the skill set of data science. Python is a great option for data science and we will see that from looking into how to become an AI quant.\n' +

                'The first part of data science that you should get used to is data manipulation. This is when we receive data and have to transform it into something we can work with. Messy data can cause great problems and is something we have to avoid at all costs, especially when working with [money and assets](best-efficient-crypto) while doing quantitative crypto trading and investing. Crypto data can come in with missing values or you may want to modify the data to your liking. After we can do what we want with our data, then we need to be able to analyze our data.\n' +
